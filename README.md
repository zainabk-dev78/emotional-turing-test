# The Emotional Turing Test

## Problem
People experiencing emotional emptiness do not need advice.
They need emotional presence.
Current AI systems respond correctly but feel emotionally hollow.

## Our Solution
We propose an AI companion that imitates human emotional presence
through pauses, uncertainty, small mistakes, and learning from users.

## Why This Is an Imitation Game
Humans are not emotionally perfect.
They misinterpret feelings, reflect, and adjust.
Our system imitates this behavior instead of giving instant answers.

## Human-Like Behaviors We Model
- Learning user comfort preferences
- Self-correction after reflection
- Respecting silence
- Emotionally consistent personality
- Occasional emotional misinterpretation

## Google Technology Used
Google Gemini is used as the conversational reasoning engine.
Behavioral rules guide Gemini to respond with emotional presence,
reflection, and correction rather than instant solutions.

## Ethics & Safety
This system is not therapy.
It discourages dependency and encourages real human connections.
